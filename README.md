Web Design Portfolio 1: Tina's Aquarium Service
This website was a project created for my upper-level Web Design and Technology course in Fall 2017.
For this project, I created a website for a company that I created and ran from 2009-2010.
I integrated solutions for the needs I had as a business owner seeking to advertise my business over the web, develop a brand identity, and generate site traffic.
